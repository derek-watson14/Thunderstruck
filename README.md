## Day/Time/TimeZone for the scheduled team weekly meeting (30 minutes via Zoom)
Sundays at 4:30pm MST 

## Vision statement: what would you tell potential customers?
Create custom flashcards to improve your knowledge retention of any subject. Flashcards are saved on your profile and can be accessed anytime, anywhere.

## Motivation: why are you working on this project?
To create a useful product with a managable scope that still incorporates all the topics of the course.

## Risks to project completion, possibly including:
- Creating web applications is new to some team members
- Balancing demands from other courses or general obligations
- No prior experience working with these team members
- Constrained delivery timeline
- Learing new technologies
- Managing version control in a distributed team

## Mitigation Strategy for above risks
- Seek out help from instructor and other resources as needed
- Focus on creating finished MVP, not including all possible features
- Clear and consistent communication between group members
- Distributing workload evenly between team members
- Have a clear agenda for meetings and a plan for each week 

## Development method: scrum, kanban, waterfall: with specifics!
Scrum
- Rotate scrum master occasionally
- Hold weekly scrum meetings
- Create full list of project requirements
- Plan at each weekly meeting what our sprint goal is for the following week - two weeks
- Create burndown chart for the project
